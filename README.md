# FetchJS README
#### A JavaScript module for providing simple AJAX functionality, written in vanilla JS and using the Fetch API
*I couldn't think of a better name, please forgive me.  I'm not much of a JS dev*

I have been building internal business applications using Django for years now and after getting used to, and frustrated with, JQuery and other JavaScript packages I decided to write my own using pure vanilla JS.  I had recently been using a few different front-end style frameworks (Bootstrap/MaterializeCSS) for rapid visual styling and interactivity.  I liked how you could instantly adjust the style and behavior of your HTML by simply applying specific class names and so I've taken that approach here.  I make use of the Fetch API as it requires no additional dependencies except that people don't use ridiculously outdated web browsers.  I designed this to work with element data attributes as I liked the interface and it seemed a good way to avoid side-effects.  Also I had gotten used to how MaterialzieCSS uses data attributes like `data-tooltip`.

**This may be a very bad implementation and I might be re-inventing multiple wheels here.**

I am sharing this code for multiple reasons but this was never intended to be something polished and a replacement for the myriad of well thought out packages that exist.  I'm simple hoping 
 * To make it easier to import into later projects (if needed)
 * To share with people who have the same need/use case
 * Possibly to get some tips on how to write better JavaScript
